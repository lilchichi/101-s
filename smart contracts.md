# Smart contracts

How are they smart tho?

![Smart contract meme](https://discover.luno.com/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-2019-04-17-at-13.17.05-300x275.png)

These are contracts written in code with the entire process mapped out from the first to the last transaction, that way you can be sure of the outcomes, throughout each step.

Pros:

- You know the entire process from start to finsh.
- Trustlessness; you don't have to know or trust the other person/group as the transaction will run as intended by the code.
-

Cons:

- Due to the code being unchangeable/immutable, there is more time for vunerabilities to be found and exploited.
- Can be difficult to read/understand by those who don't use solidity.
-
