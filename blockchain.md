# Blockchain; 101

Buzzword of the century, probably.

# What is it?

"A blockchain is a peer-to-peer network, using cryptographic functions to create a distributed ledger of immutable, or tamperproof, transactions"

Done, see you next week.

Just kidding, a simpler explanation would be along the lines of "a blockchain is a database, that's shared across a number of computers that work together to make sure the data isn't messed with".

# Ok, so how does that happen?

Transaction
Distributed to network
Verified
Added in a group to a block
Blocks are chained together, showing the history of transactions

<!--- The Steps in a Blockchain Transaction
Each blockchain transaction, no matter what industry the blockchain is being used for, goes through the same steps.

The trade or transaction is recorded in a record. The record of the transaction lists the digital signatures from each party and other relevant details.
The trade is checked to make sure it’s valid. The computers in the network look at the trade and make sure that it is a real trade or transaction. This is a decentralized process that occurs among the different nodes of the network.
As each transaction is verified and accepted as being real, it’s added to a block. Each block contains a code called a hash that is unique to that block. The block carries its own hash and the hash of the block before it so that users always know where the block should be located in the chain.
Once the block is complete—blocks can contain many transactions—it is added to the chain. The hash that it carries ensures that it is in proper chronological order. -->


We can break this down into 4 main parts:

- Blocks
- Encryption
- Distributed Systems
- Consensus

## Blocks

- Explanation
- Analogy

<!--- 
 
- You have a business that is raising money
- You recieve your first donations from 4 strangers 1️⃣, 2️⃣, 3️⃣ & 4️⃣
- Those transactions are saved into a block 🔢
- That block is check by all nodes / computers and verified to be true.
- Another 4 people send money, so another block is created to fit those new transactions 🔢⛓🔢
- Then another set of 4 people each send more money 🔢⛓🔢⛓🔢 ... Can you see the block & chains, blockchain forming.

OR

- Say you're saving money for a holiday with friends
- You set up a joint account
- You each put your share of the money into a joint account
- Everyone can then see the account has been filled, so you all confirm you have reached your target
- Then you start a new joint account for another holiday, ect.
