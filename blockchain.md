# Blockchain; 101

Buzzword of the century, probably.

# What is it?

"A blockchain is a peer-to-peer network, using cryptographic functions to create a distributed ledger of immutable, or tamperproof, transactions"

Done, see you next week.

Just kidding, a simpler explanation would be along the lines of "a blockchain is a database, that's shared across a number of computers that work together to make sure the data isn't messed with".

# Ok, so how does that happen?

So what will happen is that everytime that information is added, it's encrypted to make sure it's private & safe from being change, then shared across all the computers that make it a part of the network, once they've all confirmed the information is correct, that block gets added to the blockchain. 

We can break this down into 4 main parts:

- Blocks
- Encryption
- Distributed Systems
- Consensus

## Blocks

- Explanation
- Analogy

<!--- 
 
- You have a business that is raising money
- You recieve your first donations from 4 strangers 1️⃣, 2️⃣, 3️⃣ & 4️⃣
- Those transactions are saved into a block 🔢
- That block is check by all nodes / computers and verified to be true.
- Another 4 people send money, so another block is created to fit those new transactions 🔢⛓🔢
- Then another set of 4 people each send more money 🔢⛓🔢⛓🔢 ... Can you see the block & chains, blockchain forming.

OR

- Say you're saving money for a holiday with friends
- You set up a joint account
- You each put your share of the money into a joint account
- Everyone can then see the account has been filled, so you all confirm you have reached your target
- Then you start a new joint account for another holiday, ect.
