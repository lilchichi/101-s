# Blockchain; 101

Buzzword of the century, probably.

## What is it?

"A blockchain is a peer-to-peer network, using cryptographic functions to create a distributed ledger of immutable, or tamperproof, transactions"

Done, see you next week.

Just kidding, a simpler explanation would be along the lines of "a blockchain is a database made up of blocks of information, that's shared across a number of computers, who make that work together to make sure the data isn't messed with by making constant checks"

## Ok, so how does that happen?

1. The transaction is recorded in a record.
2. The computers in the network look at the trade and make sure that it is a real trade or transaction. This is a decentralized process that occurs among the different nodes of the network called consensus.
3. As each transaction is verified and accepted as being real, it’s added to a block.
4. Each block contains a code called a hash that is unique to that block. The block carries its own hash and the hash of the block before it so that users always know where the block should be located in the chain.
5. Once the block is complete it is added to the chain, the hash that it carries ensures that it is in proper chronological order.

If you have a good idea of what the blockchain is, then great. If you'd like to dig a little further, read below for a further breakdown with some analogies 👇

These can be broken down into 6 areas:

- Transaction/Blocks
- Digital Signature
- Distributed to network
- Verified / Consensus
- Blocks are chained together, showing the history of transactions in chronological order

### Blocks

Explanation:
This is a bunch of transactions, checked & squashed into a block.

<pre>
Analogy; Christmas
  - Each person getting a present = Transaction/Record
  - Each present wrapping their presents in their own wrapping paper (grandparents always use the same wrapping paper, every year 😅) = Block
  - Those wrapped presents are added to the Christmas tree = Blockchain 
</pre>

<pre>
 Analogy; Bank account
  - Your bank statement = Blockchain 
  - Receipt of all your shopping items = Block
  - Each item on that shopping receipt = Transaction/Record
 </pre>

 <pre>
 Analogy; Raising money for a business
  - You have a business that is raising money
  - You recieve your first donations from 4 strangers 1️⃣, 2️⃣, 3️⃣ & 4️⃣
  - Those transactions are check by all nodes / computers
  - If verified to be true, those transactions are saved into a block 🔢
  - Another 4 people send money, so again, those transactions are checked and another block is created to fit those new transactions 🔢⛓🔢
  - Then the process repeats again 🔢⛓🔢⛓🔢 ... Can you see the block & chains ... blockchain forming?
</pre>

<pre>
 Analogy; Saving money for a holiday with friends
  - We've all got friends who are the most responsible, in this example we'll name them Alice, Bob, Lucy & Alejandro. They're each responsible for collecting money for a different thing, let's say flights, hotel & activities.
  - We each send our share of the money to them = Transaction/Record 1️⃣, 2️⃣, 3️⃣ & 4️⃣
  - Once Alice has recieved collected the money for the flights she'll check and everyone has paid = Block 🔢 
  - Bob repeats = Block 🔢
  - Lucy repeats = Block 🔢 
  - All that money is moved the the holiday account so we can go on a great holiday ☀ 🍹 = Blockchain 🔢⛓🔢⛓🔢

### Encryption

- This is simply a way of scrambling a message (by using one or more mathematical techniques and algorythms) so strangers and people that you don't want to read it won't be able to understand it. The only way to make it readable again is by having the password or the key. There are a variety of encryption methods which we can cover in another section.
- Analogy ...

### Distributed Systems

- A distributed system is a system that spread across smaller systems, meaning all of the power is not in one specific place, this means that it is much harder to hack / infiltrate these types of systems as you would have to take down all of the smaller systems and there could be many.
- Analogy ...

### Consensus

- Consensus is a way for a group to agree, specifically with blockchain we are referring to a group/network of computers agreeing that a transaction is correct.

<pre>
Analogy; Voting
  - Each person votes (digitally or on paper), then submits their vote = Transaction/Record
  - All votes are counted, by several different groups = Consensus method
  - Groups who counted the votes, share results and agree the numbers are correct = Consensus reached
</pre>

<pre>
Analogy; Wedding
  - Two people are being married = Transaction/Record
  - The crowd are asked to speak if they do not agree = Consensus method
  - If everyone stays quiet and allows the wedding to continue a non-verbal agreement has been reached = Consensus reached
</pre>

## How can it be used for?

- Storing confidential information
  - Passwords
  - Writing
- Making sure information is not tampered with & changed
  - Contracts
  - Receipts
  - Goverment or council spending

## Why is it important?

- Trustless
- Tranparancy
- Freedom
- Privacy
