# Blockchain; 101

Buzzword of the century, probably.

# What is it?

"A blockchain is a peer-to-peer network, using cryptographic functions to create a distributed ledger of immutable, or tamperproof, transactions"

Done, see you next week.

Just kidding, a simpler explanation would be along the lines of "a blockchain is a database, that's shared across a number of computers that work together to make sure the data isn't messed with".

# How does it work?

We can break this down into several areas:

- Information is saved into block 
- Saving iformation
- That blocks holds a certain amount of information
- Once the block fills up, a new block is created to hold the new information
- All those blocks are connected in a chain, hence the name "blockchain"

OR 

- You have a business that is raising money
- You recieve your first donations from 4 strangers 1️⃣, 2️⃣, 3️⃣ & 4️⃣
- Those transactions are saved into a block 🔢
- That block is check by all nodes / computers and verified to be true.
- Another 4 people send money, so another block is created to fit those new transactions 🔢⛓🔢
- Then another set of 4 people each send more money 🔢⛓🔢⛓🔢 ... Can you see the block & chains, blockchain forming.

OR

- Say you're saving money for a holiday with friends
- You set up a joint account
- You each put your share of the money into a joint account
- Everyone can then see the account has been filled, so you all confirm you have reached your target
- Then you start a new joint account for another holiday, ect.

However with decentralisation it allows you to have the same level of trust without knowing anyone, since it's a computer programme/algorythm allowing all the computers to check they are all seeing the same information.

- Peer-to-peer
- Network
- Cryptographic
- Distributed
- Consensus

# How can it be used for?

- Storing confidential information
- Making sure information is not tampered with & changed
- 

# Why is it important?

- Trustless
- Tranparancy
- Freedom
- Privacy
