# Welcome to 101's

## Why?

🤓 I've always thought that if you can break down concepts into understanable chunks then it helps you learn & also others too - So that's what I'm doing, creating 101's and/or intro's into topics

🍄 Feel free to have a look through & suggest corrections so that I can level up (I'm expecting to be humbled)
